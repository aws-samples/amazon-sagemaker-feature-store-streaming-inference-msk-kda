The notebook identifies the source/destination MSK topics and defines schema for the respective topics via AWS Glue Schema Registry. In addition, this notebook creates a streaming SQL query to aggregate data from the source MSK topic and store the results in the destination MSK topic. \n\nWith a simple click of a few buttons the process to identify records in the source MSK topic, define logic and push it to the destination topic is accomplished. By using Flink SQL, the logic is understandable in natural language without any need to learn programming languages. Once the data transformation logic is defined in this notebook, you can build your code and export it to Amazon S3. You can promote the code that you wrote in your note to a continuously running stream processing application. After you deploy a note to run in streaming mode, Kinesis Data Analytics creates an application for you that runs continuously, reads data from your sources, writes to your destinations, maintains long-running application state, and autoscales automatically based on the throughput of your source streams. Documentation on this topic is available at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/what-is.html.",
